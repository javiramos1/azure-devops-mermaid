## ü§ù Option 2: Find a Co-Publisher

If you absolutely cannot create an Azure DevOps account, you could:

### Approach Someone Who Has an Account

1. **Find a trusted developer** with an Azure DevOps account
2. **Ask them to publish** under their publisher ID
3. **Transfer ownership later** when you get an account

**Cons:**
- Requires finding someone trustworthy
- Extension published under their name initially
- Complicates future updates
- Harder to build your personal brand

**Where to find co-publishers:**
- Azure DevOps community forums
- r/azuredevops on Reddit
- Your professional network
- Open source communities

## üì¶ Option 3: Alternative Distribution Methods

While not "official marketplace publishing," you can still distribute your extension:

### A. GitHub Releases (Already Set Up!)

Your extension is already configured for this:

```bash
# Create release
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0"
git push origin v2.0.0

# GitHub Actions will:
# ‚úÖ Build .vsix file
# ‚úÖ Create GitHub release
# ‚úÖ Attach .vsix for download
```

**Users can install manually:**
1. Download `.vsix` from your GitHub releases
2. In Azure DevOps: Organization Settings ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí **Upload new extension**
3. Browse for the `.vsix` file
4. Click **Upload**

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No Azure DevOps account needed
- ‚úÖ Full control over releases
- ‚úÖ Works for your organization
- ‚úÖ Already automated via GitHub Actions!

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Not in public marketplace
- ‚ùå No discoverability
- ‚ùå Manual installation required
- ‚ùå No automatic updates

### B. Direct VSIX Distribution

Host the `.vsix` file yourself:

```bash
# Build extension
npm run build

# Host on:
# - Your website
# - GitHub Pages
# - Cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob)
# - Package registry
```

Users install by:
1. Downloading `.vsix` from your site
2. Uploading to their Azure DevOps organization

### C. Private Organization Installation

If you work for a company with Azure DevOps:

```bash
# Install directly in your org
# 1. Build the extension
npm run build

# 2. Upload to your organization
# Organization Settings ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Upload
```

**This works without marketplace publishing!**
